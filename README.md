🌍 Energy Consumption & Emission Analysis

This project contains a SQL-based data model and queries for analyzing global energy consumption, production, GDP, emissions, and population trends.
📂 Database Schema
The database ENERGYDB2 includes the following tables:
 country – List of countries
 emission_3 – Emissions by country, year, and energy type
 population – Population by country and year
 production – Energy production by country and year
 gdp_3 – GDP by country and year
 consumption – Energy consumption by country and year
📊 Key Analyses
 The SQL script provides insights such as:
Total emissions per country (latest year)
Top 5 countries by GDP
Production vs Consumption trends
Energy types contributing most to emissions
Global emissions year-over-year
GDP trends per country
Population vs Emissions analysis
Consumption trends for major economies (USA, China, India, Germany, Japan)
 Per capita emissions and consumption
 Emission-to-GDP ratios
 Countries reducing per capita emissions in the last decade
 Global share of emissions by country
🚀 How to Use
Import the SQL file into MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.
Run the script to create tables and relationships.
Execute queries to explore energy, GDP, population, and emission insights.
🔮 Future Enhancements
Add visualization (Power BI / Tableau / Python dashboards)
Integrate real-time datasets (World Bank, IEA, UN)
Predictive modeling for future energy demand & emissions
