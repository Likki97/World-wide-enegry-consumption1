🌍 Energy Consumption & Emission Analysis

This project contains a SQL-based data model and queries for analyzing global energy consumption, production, GDP, emissions, and population trends.
📂 Database Schema
The database ENERGYDB2 includes the following tables:
1. country – List of countries
2. emission_3 – Emissions by country, year, and energy type
3. population – Population by country and year
4. production – Energy production by country and year
5. gdp_3 – GDP by country and year
6. consumption – Energy consumption by country and year
📊 Key Analyses
1. The SQL script provides insights such as:
2. Total emissions per country (latest year)
3. Top 5 countries by GDP
4. Production vs Consumption trends
5. Energy types contributing most to emissions
6. Global emissions year-over-year
7. GDP trends per country
8. Population vs Emissions analysis
9. Consumption trends for major economies (USA, China, India, Germany, Japan)
10. Per capita emissions and consumption
11. Emission-to-GDP ratios
12. Countries reducing per capita emissions in the last decade
13. Global share of emissions by country
🚀 How to Use
Import the SQL file into MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.
Run the script to create tables and relationships.
Execute queries to explore energy, GDP, population, and emission insights.
🔮 Future Enhancements
Add visualization (Power BI / Tableau / Python dashboards)
Integrate real-time datasets (World Bank, IEA, UN)
Predictive modeling for future energy demand & emissions
